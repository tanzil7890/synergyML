SynergyML is a comprehensive Python framework for multimodal analysis, specializing in synchronized video-audio processing, emotion detection, and LLM-enhanced analysis.

## Core Components

### 1. Video Processing
- Scene detection and analysis
- Frame-level feature extraction
- Motion tracking and optical flow
- Deep feature extraction using pre-trained models
- Object detection via YOLOv8
- Face and emotion detection using DeepFace

### 2. Audio Processing
- Spectral analysis (MFCCs, mel spectrograms)
- Onset detection and rhythm analysis
- Speech-to-text processing
- Emotion detection from audio
- Advanced audio feature extraction

### 3. Multimodal Fusion
- Video-audio synchronization
- Cross-modal correlation analysis
- Feature fusion strategies
- Temporal alignment optimization
- Quality assessment metrics

### 4. LLM Integration
- Context-aware processing
- Memory management for long sequences
- Enhanced emotion analysis
- Advanced prompting system

## Installation

```bash
# Core installation
pip install synergyml

# Optional components
pip install synergyml[video] # Video processing
pip install synergyml[audio] # Audio processing
pip install synergyml[llama_cpp] # LLM integration

```

## Quick Start

```python
from synergyml.multimodal.av_analysis import VideoProcessor, AudioProcessor

# Initialize processors
video_processor = VideoProcessor()
audio_processor = AudioProcessor()

# Process video and audio
video_data, audio_data = video_processor.process_video(video_path), audio_processor.process_audio(audio_path)
```
## Initialize analyzer
```python
analyzer = MultimodalAnalyzer(
use_gpu=True,
cache_dir="./cache"
)
```
## Process video with audio
```python
results = analyzer.analyze_media(
video_path="video.mp4",
analyze_emotions=True,
extract_features=True
)
```

## Access results
```python
print(results['emotions'])
print(results['features']['video'])
print(results['features']['audio'])
```
