# Pipeline Visualization in SynergyML

This document describes the pipeline visualization capabilities in SynergyML, which allow you to analyze and visualize the performance of your LLM-enhanced multimodal analysis pipeline.

## Features

### 1. Pipeline Performance Visualization
- **Execution Time Analysis**: Box plots showing execution time distribution by model
- **Quality Metrics Distribution**: Violin plots of various quality metrics
- **Token Usage Analysis**: Bar charts of average token usage by model
- **Model Selection Distribution**: Pie chart showing model usage distribution
- **Performance Trends**: Time series analysis of quality metrics
- **Quality-Speed Tradeoff**: Scatter plots showing relationship between execution time and quality
- **Quality Metrics Radar**: Radar plots showing different quality dimensions
- **Quality Metrics Timeline**: Time series of individual quality metrics

### 2. Detailed Quality Analysis
- **Quality Metrics Distribution**: Violin plots for individual metrics
- **Quality Metrics Correlation**: Heatmap showing correlations between metrics
- **Quality vs Complexity**: Scatter plot analyzing relationship with content complexity
- **Quality vs Token Usage**: Analysis of quality relative to token consumption
- **Quality Metrics Timeline**: Temporal analysis of quality metrics
- **Quality Components Analysis**: Breakdown of quality components

## Usage

### Basic Pipeline Visualization
```python
from synergyml.multimodal.llm_integration import LLMEnhancedAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = LLMEnhancedAnalyzer(llm_backend='gpt', use_gpu=True)

# Generate basic visualization
fig = analyzer.plot_pipeline_performance(
    time_window=30,  # Last 30 days
    interactive=True
)

# Save visualization
fig.write_html("pipeline_performance.html")
```

### Detailed Model Analysis
```python
# Analyze specific model
fig = analyzer.plot_quality_details(
    model_name='gpt-4',
    time_window=7  # Last week
)
```

### Filtered Analysis
```python
# Filter by model and quality
fig = analyzer.plot_pipeline_performance(
    model_filter=['gpt-4', 'gpt-3.5-turbo'],
    min_quality=0.8,
    interactive=True
)
```

## Interactive Features

1. **Time Range Selection**
   - Buttons for different time ranges
   - Range sliders for timeline plots

2. **Hover Information**
   - Detailed metrics on hover
   - Model-specific information
   - Timestamp details

3. **Layout Controls**
   - Zoom controls
   - Pan capabilities
   - Reset button

## Best Practices

1. **Performance Analysis**
   - Monitor trends over time to identify performance patterns
   - Use filtered analysis to focus on specific models or quality thresholds
   - Compare models using detailed quality analysis

2. **Quality Assessment**
   - Use radar plots to identify strengths and weaknesses
   - Monitor correlation between different quality metrics
   - Track quality-speed tradeoffs

3. **Visualization Tips**
   - Save interactive visualizations for detailed exploration
   - Use appropriate time windows for different analyses
   - Leverage filters to focus on relevant data

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **No Data Available**
   - Ensure the analyzer has processed some data
   - Check time window settings
   - Verify model filter settings

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce time window for large datasets
   - Use filtered analysis for specific investigations
   - Save visualizations as HTML for better performance

3. **Visualization Clarity**
   - Adjust layout parameters as needed
   - Use annotations to highlight important patterns
   - Leverage interactive features for detailed exploration

## Example Workflows

1. **Regular Performance Monitoring**
   ```python
   # Weekly performance check
   analyzer.plot_pipeline_performance(time_window=7).write_html("weekly_report.html")
   ```

2. **Model Comparison**
   ```python
   # Compare models
   for model in ['gpt-4', 'gpt-3.5-turbo']:
       analyzer.plot_quality_details(model_name=model).write_html(f"{model}_analysis.html")
   ```

3. **Quality Investigation**
   ```python
   # Investigate high-quality results
   analyzer.plot_pipeline_performance(min_quality=0.9).write_html("high_quality_analysis.html")
   ```

## Advanced Features

1. **Custom Annotations**
   ```python
   fig = analyzer.plot_pipeline_performance()
   fig.add_annotation(
       text="Important trend",
       x="2023-01-01",
       y=0.8,
       showarrow=True
   )
   ```

2. **Layout Customization**
   ```python
   fig.update_layout(
       height=1600,
       width=1400,
       title_text="Custom Pipeline Analysis"
   )
   ```

3. **Export Options**
   ```python
   # Save as interactive HTML
   fig.write_html("analysis.html")
   
   # Save as static image
   fig.write_image("analysis.png")
   ```
